This page documents the `Config` options for Trase_Gangs (see `config.lua`), what they do, and how to modify them safely.

> Quick tip: always make a backup of `config.lua` before making changes in production.

---

## Top-level settings

- `Config.Language` (string)
  - Default: `'en'`
  - Which locale file to use from `locales/` (e.g., `en.lua`, `fr.lua` if present). Change to match your supported language.

- `Config.Debug` (boolean)
  - Default: `false`
  - When `true` the resource prints verbose debug messages to the server console. Useful while setting up or diagnosing issues.

- `Config.InteractionType` (string)
  - Default: `'ox_lib'`
  - Set which interaction system the client uses. Supported values: `ox_lib` or `ox_target` (choose whichever you have installed).

- `Config.Framework` (string)
  - Default: `'auto'`
  - Auto-detects supported frameworks (ESX / QBCore / QBox / Standalone). Change only if you want to explicitly set the framework (e.g. `'ESX'` or `'QBCore'`).

## Commands (Config.Commands)

These are the chat/console commands users and admins can call. Change keys to customize command names:

- `GangManage` — default `gangmanage` (opens gang management UI for users in a gang)
- `ServerManagement` — default `gangs` (admin-only server management UI)
- `GangLeaderboard` — default `gangleaderboard` (opens leaderboard UI)

Example: to change the leaderboard command to `/leaderboard`, edit:
```lua
Config.Commands.GangLeaderboard = 'leaderboard'
```

---

## Handler config (Config.Handler)

Controls core gang handling and defaults.

- `DefaultMaxMembers` (number) — default `10`
  - Default maximum members for newly-created gangs.

- `DefaultMaxRanks` (number) — default `5`
  - Default rank slots created for new gangs.

- `InviteExpiryTime` (number) — default `3600` (seconds)
  - How long invites remain valid before expiring (seconds).

- `ReputationEnabled` (boolean) — default `true`
  - Toggle reputation system.

- `ReputationRewards` (table)
  - Numeric reputation rewards for various victory types (Turf, Drugzone, GangWar). Example:
  ```lua
  ReputationRewards = { TurfWin = 100, DrugzoneWin = 75, GangWarWin = 150 }
  ```

- `UnlocksEnabled` (boolean) — default `true`
  - Allow gangs to purchase unlocks (e.g., storage upgrades, member slots).

- `Unlocks` (table) — a map of unlock keys to cost and label, e.g.:
  ```lua
  Unlocks = {
    storage_upgrade_1 = { cost = 500, label = 'Storage Upgrade Tier 1' },
    member_slots_1 = { cost = 750, label = '+5 Member Slots' },
  }
  ```

Adjust costs/labels based on your economy.

## Features (Config.Features)

Each feature block toggles subsystems and config options.

### Drugzones
- `Enabled` (boolean) — Enable the drugzone game type.
- `Duration` (seconds) — How long a drugzone event runs.
- `WinningPoints` (number) — Points needed for a win.
- `PointsPerSecond` (number) — Points accumulated per second when in control.
- `MarkerType` (number) & `MarkerColor` (table) — Visual markers.
- `Zones` (table) — Named zones that include `coords` (vector3/vec3), `radius`, optional NPC spawn data, and `KillRewards` table.

Example zone config snippet in `config.lua`:
```lua
Zones = {
  ['Testing Zone'] = {
    coords = vector3(398.6851, -1996.0840, 22.1991),
    radius = 50.0,
    NPC = { model = 's_m_m_chemsec_01', coords = vector4(...), scenario = 'WORLD_HUMAN_GUARD_PATROL' },
    KillRewards = { Enabled = true, Rewards = { [1] = {label='First Kill', rewards = {['money'] = 5000}} } }
  }
}
```

### Turfs
- `Enabled` (boolean) — Enable turf zones.
- `Duration` (seconds) — How long the turf capture takes.
- `Zones` — Similar to Drugzones, zones for turfs.
- `KillRewards` — Optional kill-based reward tiers.

### GangWars
- `Enabled` (boolean) — Enable gang-wars subsystem.
- `KillFeed` (boolean) — Show kill feed related to wars.
- `MinWager` / `MaxWager` — Min/max betting values for wagers between gangs.
- `TargetKills` — Kills required to win a gang war.

### Leaderboards
- `Enabled` (boolean) — Toggle leaderboard systems (server UI & NUI support).

---

## UI (Config.UI)

Controls the NUI appearance and colors. Example values are hex color strings used across the web UI.

- `Colors` — A table of color keys used in the front-end (bg_dark, bg_panel, accent, danger, text_primary, border etc.). Edit them to theme the UI. Example:
```lua
Config.UI.Colors.accent = '#3b82f6'
```

> Tip: You can replace the color palette to quickly switch the theme (a red theme example is included as commented-out code in `config.lua`).

---

## Notes / Safety

- Changing `DefaultMaxMembers`/`DefaultMaxRanks` affects newly created gangs only; existing gangs keep their saved values in the DB.
- If you disable a feature (e.g., `Config.Features.Drugzones.Enabled = false`) the module won't be loaded at startup.
- Always restart the resource after making changes to `config.lua` for them to apply.

If you'd like I can convert this into inline comments inside `config.lua` or add a sample `server.cfg` snippet in a separate `EXTRA.md` file. Want me to add either?
