## Installation Steps

### 1. Download and Extract
```bash
# Download the resource and extract to your resources folder
[trase]/
└── trase_garage/
    ├── fxmanifest.lua
    ├── config.lua
    ├── client/
    ├── server/
    ├── framework/
    └── locales/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure the following resources are installed and started **before** trase_garage:

```lua
-- In your server.cfg, make sure these are started first:
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_lib
ensure [your_framework] -- es_extended, qb-core, or qbx-core
```

### 3. Database Setup
No additional database setup is required. The script uses your existing framework's vehicle tables.

### 4. Configuration
Please visit [Configuration Guide](/freeresources/garage/config-guide)

## Usage

### For Players

#### Storing Vehicles
1. Drive your vehicle to a garage location
2. Look for the blue storage marker
3. Press `E` when prompted to store the vehicle
4. The vehicle will be safely stored in the garage

#### Retrieving Vehicles
1. Walk to a garage entrance marker
2. Press `E` to open the garage
3. Use arrow keys (← →) to browse your stored vehicles
4. Press `Enter` to retrieve the selected vehicle
5. Press `Backspace` to cancel browsing

#### Impound System
1. Go to an impound location
2. Press `E` to view impounded vehicles  
3. Browse and select the vehicle to retrieve
4. Pay the impound fee to get your vehicle back

### For Administrators

#### Adding New Garages
1. Open `config.lua`
2. Add a new entry to `Config.Garages`
3. Set the entrance, browse, and storage coordinates
4. Restart the resource

#### Setting Impound Locations
1. Configure `Config.Impound.Locations`
2. Set the retrieval price in `Config.Impound.Price`
3. Enable/disable with `Config.Impound.Enabled`

## Localization

The script supports multiple languages. To add a new language:

1. Create a new file in `locales/` (e.g., `de.json` for German)
2. Copy the structure from `en.json`
3. Translate all text strings
4. The script will automatically detect and use the locale

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Script Not Loading
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and started first
- Check console for error messages
- Verify fxmanifest.lua is not corrupted

#### Database Errors
- Confirm your framework's vehicle table exists
- Check MySQL connection string in server.cfg
- Verify table column names match your framework

#### Vehicles Not Appearing
- Ensure vehicles are properly stored in database
- Check vehicle state/stored column values
- Verify player ownership in database

#### Framework Not Detected
```lua
-- Manually set framework in config.lua if auto-detection fails
Config.Framework = 'esx' -- or 'qb', 'qbx'
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug prints by checking server console for framework detection messages:
```
[Trase_Garage] [INFO]: ESX framework detected and set.
```
